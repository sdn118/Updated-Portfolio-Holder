            <p>
              I have only been coding for little over a year and a half now. Honestly it was something I never expected to get into, but I am so glad I did. I enjoy so much to design websites and learning how websites and apps actually work in our everyday lives. I am a hardworking individual who is hoping to one day make this into an enjoyable career. Please take you time to look over my resume and links. And thank you for your time!
